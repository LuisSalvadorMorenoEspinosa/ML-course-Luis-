M5-01 file, Python Notebook:

A mix of initial exercises in Python, in order to learn how to work with this program. I made some examples of  variables and types, list,
tuples and so on.

M5-02 file, Conditionals:

I made three conditionals exercises. 

  First of them, a listing of Marvels'heroes was done in 'if-elif-else' format.
  The second one, a leap year exercise with the 'if-else' structure and the operators 'and' and 'or'
  And the last one, a palindrome exercise
